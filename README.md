Just a project that I wanted to do in Highschool three years ago. I never finished the project because of a lack of css basis and commitment, but I came back from a 2 year foriegn lds mission when I found out what ChatGTP was and I asked it to do it for me. The site is missing images and content in general, extra pages, and more content. but the structure of the Home Page in less than the 2 minutes it took to write the prompt and less than 15 seconds to generate a prompt, and maybe 3 minutes to push it to GitHub absolutely astounded me. my plan is to make some minor style changes, add extra pages, likely with more ai generated html files, and my own content.
