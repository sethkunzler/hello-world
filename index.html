  <p>Hi everyone my name is Seth. This is the first project I uploaded to GitHub. I took about two years worth of web design classes in highschool and don't remember diddly-squat but I am doing the boot camp course with Boise CodeWorks on full stack web development so we should be golden to make our own content after April, 22nd of 2024
